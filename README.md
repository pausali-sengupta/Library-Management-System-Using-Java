Library Management System is to create a separate class for handling the catalog of books, and another class for handling the individual books. This would allow for better organization and separation of concerns, as well as making the code more reusable. The Library class holds a list of all the books in the library and has methods for adding and removing books, as well as displaying all the books in the library. The Library Management System class handles the user interface and communication between the Book and Library classes, using a Scanner object to get user input and controlling the overall flow of the program

A Library Management System is a software application that helps to manage and organize the daily operations of a library.

A Book class is created that will hold information about each book in the library, including the title, author, ISBN, and availability status.  Finally, a Library Management System class is created that will handle the user interface and communication between the Book and Library classes.

Book class will have four instance variables: Title, Author, ISBN, and Availability. These variables will hold the respective information about each book. A constructor is also included that will take in the values for each variable and set them to the corresponding instance variables.
